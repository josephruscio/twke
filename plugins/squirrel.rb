#
# Squirrel: Ship all the things!
#
# Provides a set of twke commands for continuous integration
# shipping. Translates shipping commands into CLI arguments that are
# passed to the configured ship command. It will track shipping status
# and output success/fail messages. Supports a 'staging' and
# 'production' environment for all commands.
#
# Commands are designed around the model of capistrano.
#
# Configuration:
#
#   squirrel.apps = ['app1', 'app2']
#
#     An array of applications that can be shipped.
#
#   squirrel.cmd = "/path/to/shipit.sh"
#
#     Program that is invoked to actually ship.
#
#   squirrel.environ = {"MYVAR" => "MYVAL"}
#
#     Hash of environment variables to pass to ship command.
#
#   squirrel.max_age_secs = <integer>
#
#     How old can a branch be before it's rejected and
#     requires a forced ship.
#
#   squirrel.images_baseurl
#   squirrel.images_count
#   squirrel.images_suffix
#
#     Ship and be rewarded!
#
#     Configure a set of rotating images that are displayed when code
#     is successfully shipped to production. This lets everyone know
#     it's time to party. By default you'll see some furry creatures
#     lending a helping hand for your celebration.
#
#
# Help:
#  For a list of supported shipping commands, run `ship help`.

I support the following ship commands:
  (Supported applications: #{get_apps.join(",")})
  (Environment always defaults to staging)

> ship <app> [staging|production]

  Ships 'master' to <app> with environment staging or production.

> ship <branch> to <app> [staging|production]

  Ships <branch> to <app> with environment staging or production.

> ship <branch> to <app> (staging|production) force

  Ships <branch> to <app> with environment staging or production.
  If <branch> is determined to be too old, this will force ship
  the branch.

> ship <app> environ [staging|production]

  Ships the latest app environment to <app> and restarts the app.

> ship <app> migrate [staging|production]

  Runs the migration for the specified <app> using the previously
  deployed code.

> ship <app> maintenance:(on|off) [staging|production]

  Put the application into maintenance mode (maintenance:on) or
  disable maintenance mode (maintenance:off) for <app>.

> ship <app> revision [staging|production]

  Show the deployed revision.
