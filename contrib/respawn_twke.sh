# This script assumes that you've created a user account e.g. `twke`
# whose home directory can be used for log files. Either this user
# or the system should have an rvm installation with Ruby 1.9.2. Copy
# this script into that user's ~/bin
#
# You can then put a command such as the following in your
# /etc/inittab to ensure twke always restarts with the latest
# code, including through the 'twke respawn' command:
#
# # Run twke
# twke:345:respawn:/bin/su -c '/home/twke/bin/respawn_twke.sh' twke
